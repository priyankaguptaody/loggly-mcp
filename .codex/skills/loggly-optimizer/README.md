# loggly Optimizer

Reduce token usage and API volume when investigating logs with loggly MCP tools.

## Skill Files

- `SKILL.md`: source-of-truth behavior and workflow.
- `agents/openai.yaml`: skill metadata for Codex UI.
- `references/query-patterns.md`: optional advanced query and reduction patterns.

## Core Outcome

Use staged, narrow queries that prioritize counts/facets before raw events, then return compact grouped findings instead of large log dumps.
